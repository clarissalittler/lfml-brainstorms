# Purpose of this doc
Collate plans about what the underlying lfml.js library should have in it and be able to do
# Markov processes
# Automatic differentiation
# Neural networks
# Genetic algorithms
# Patching API
Station has thoughts on how to create some kind of interface that lets us connect inputs and outputs of this library to each other in a temporally controlled way 

ccl thoughts: are we thinking just regular sampling intervals or are we going to allow for more complex sampling timings a la tidalcycles/strudel?

Either way, it's a solid idea that we should try to make possible
