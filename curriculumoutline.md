- Get pitch, yaw and roll from mobile phone via [sensors api](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Sensor_APIs) (chrome-like browsers + safari)
- Create a data set of 3 classes (using phone, phone flat, phone in bags or pockets)
- Use kNN to see if our "shady app" can classify user "phone engagement" from background polling the position
- Discussion: "meaning" of data. does position really map to use?
